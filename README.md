Repository for our class CTF Project  
I have mine running in CentOS, but I imagine any linux distro will work.  
Make sure you're using Python2, not 3.  
Due to the way challenges are saved (inside the sqlite db file), don't push to master.  
Make your own branch and push to that.  
When you're ready to merge your challenges:  
1. Let the admin know if you want to add challenges  
2. Point admin to relevant files on your branch  

If you are part of the class, take a look at the relevant sections of our WIKI at https://utischoolctflab.wikispaces.com/home  
This should tell you everything you need to know about contributing and/or playing the game.
